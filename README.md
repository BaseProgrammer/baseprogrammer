# Hello!

## I'm just a Front End Developer with a knowledge of 5+ languages.
**Bash, C/C++, CSS, HTML, Java, Javascript, NodeJS, [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)**

I create most of my websites with the [EJS](https://ejs.co/) framework in Nodejs and have a basic understanding of most the knowledgable coding languages. Preferably, [javascript](https://javascript.com) is one of my favourite languages since it is event-driven, functional and imperative; but the sad thing is that it runs code from top to bottom. For example, if you put "while true {}" on your browser console, you won't be able to do anything (easy fix: restart browser). I also use [electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) for making UIs.

My first language was actually batchfile, and I started to teach it in my school during lunchtimes in school. I got really intrigued into making websites and wanted to make my innovative ideas a thing.
